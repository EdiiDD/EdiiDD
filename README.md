<h3>👨🏽‍💻 About Me </h3>

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm Edy, an Android Engineer with over 3 years of experience. During my final year of university, I started with Android development by creating a simple app chat for the practice of a subject. I enjoyed studying about the Android ecosystem so much that my degree final project consisted on developing an actual Android app.

At the same time I was finishing my Computer Engineering, I also started working at WeFish, a Fishing app. I refactored the data layer using all of the knowledge I gained while developing my degree final project, so that we could implement unit tests. After the refactor, we were able to add both more use cases and tests in the domain layer.

After that, I worked on different projects where I acquired new knowledge, such as Jetpack Compose or Multimodule. Right now I’m working on a side project with these two concepts, which you can check out on my GitHub page. Also, I'm studying at Universitat Obertade Catalunya the Master's Degree in Web Site and Application Development.
